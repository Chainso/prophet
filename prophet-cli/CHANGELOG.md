## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Implemented Node Express + Mongoose stack (`node_express_mongoose`) with:

  - generated Mongoose repository adapters,
  - stack matrix/manifest registration and test coverage.
- Added a complete runnable example at `examples/node/prophet_example_express_mongoose` with generated integration wiring and concrete action handlers.

- Node docs/quickstart/developer guides updated to cover Mongoose targets, stack ids, and validation flow.
- Top-level README updated to list the Express + Mongoose example.

### Fixed
- Mongoose code generation type emission now qualifies object-ref and struct document field types against generated domain types (`Domain.*`) so generated TypeScript compiles cleanly.
- Toolchain/package version advanced to `0.9.0`.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-15

### Changed
- CI/publish Node example dependency installs now use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` to keep lockfiles immutable in validation jobs.
- Toolchain/package version advanced to `0.8.4`.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Node Express transition event contracts now match the simplified transition model and no longer generate `fromState` / `toState` payload fields.

### Changed
- Java Spring example ontology version updated to `1.0.0` so compatibility checks align with required major bump semantics.
- README wording updated to use `Generation manifests` capitalization.
- Toolchain/package version advanced to `0.8.3`.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Node Express ESM codegen now emits explicit `.js` relative import specifiers in generated TypeScript sources to satisfy `moduleResolution: NodeNext` builds.
- Node Express + TypeORM codegen nullability/strictness fixes:
  - generated entity fields now use strict-property-safe declarations for required columns,
  - nullable columns now emit `| null`-aware field types,
  - generated adapters map optional domain values to nullable persistence columns consistently.
- Node target test expectations aligned with strict TypeORM entity output.

### Changed
- Added Node example build output ignore rule for `examples/node/**/dist/`.
- Toolchain/package version advanced to `0.8.2`.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Node Express + TypeORM runtime initialization bug in generated repositories:
  - generated `TypeOrmRepository` classes now initialize `repo` inside constructors (after `DataSource` is available),
  - prevents `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getRepository')` on app startup.
- Node Express + Prisma generation compatibility improvements:
  - Prisma datasource provider is generated as a concrete provider value (default `sqlite`, configurable in `prophet.yaml`),
  - provider/env and list/struct schema edge cases resolved for generated Prisma schema and adapters.

### Changed
- Expanded docs and references for Node runtime behavior and TypeORM production DB ownership (`DataSource` configuration in host app).
- Updated AGENTS/developer/user docs structure and removed obsolete Node roadmap document.
- Added repository ignore rules for local Node example SQLite test DB files.

- Toolchain/package version advanced to `0.8.1`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Automatic source hydration for missing DSL IDs:
  - parsing commands now materialize generated `id "..."` lines back into the ontology file,
  - stable, non-conflicting IDs are synthesized for ontology elements when omitted.
- Integration coverage for source ID hydration behavior in CLI tests.

### Changed
- Action contract syntax is now inline-only:
  - `input { ... }`
  - `output { ... }`
- DSL field ergonomics updated so fields are required by default; users only write `optional` for nullable fields.
- Updated DSL reference and canonical Spring example ontology to reflect the new contract and requiredness rules.
- Toolchain/package version advanced to `0.8.0`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- Generated event contracts for ontology events under `generated.events.*`:
  - `action_output` event payload wrappers,
  - `signal` event contracts,
  - `transition` event contracts including `fromState`/`toState`.
- Generated `GeneratedEventEmitter` interface with one typed emit method per event.
- Generated default `GeneratedEventEmitterNoOp` Spring component for zero-config event emission wiring.

### Changed
- Generated action service defaults now emit their corresponding `action_output` events automatically after handler execution.
- Event model generation now includes object reference records required by event payload contracts.
- Toolchain/package version advanced to `0.7.0`.

### Changed
- Hardened CI into separate package and Spring integration jobs, with generated-output cleanliness verification and tracked-file drift checks.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- Updated the Spring example README to reflect current generated API behavior:
  - `GET /<objects>` as pagination/sort only.
  - typed filtering centralized on `POST /<objects>/query`.
  - ontology-scoped generated package path examples.
- Synced generated example manifest/module metadata to toolchain version `0.5.3`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
